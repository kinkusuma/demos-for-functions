# üöÆ Clean up files in your storage older than XX days
A sample Ruby Cloud Function for deleting files that are older than `XX` days on a schedule.

## üìù Environment Variables
Go to Settings tab of your Cloud Function. Add the following environment variables.

* **APPWRITE_ENDPOINT** - Your Appwrite Endpoint
* **APPWRITE_API_KEY** - Your Appwrite API key with `files.read` and `files.write` permissions
* **DAYS_TO_EXPIRE** - Number of days after which files will expire

## üöÄ Building and Packaging

To package this example as a cloud function, follow these steps.

```bash
$ cd demos-for-functions/ruby/storage-cleaner

$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app --env GEM_HOME=./.appwrite appwrite/env-ruby-2.7:1.0.2 bundle install
```

* Ensure that your folder structure looks like this:

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .appwrite/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rb
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

* Create a tarball

```bash
$ cd ..

$ tar -zcvf code.tar.gz storage-cleaner
```

* Navigate to the Overview Tab of your Cloud Function > Deploy Tag
* Input the command that will run your function (in this case `ruby main.rb`) as your entrypoint command
* Upload your tarfile
* Click 'Activate'

## ‚è∞ Schedule

Head over to your function in the Appwrite console and under the Settings Tab, enter a reasonable schedule time (cron syntax).

For example:

- `*/30 * * * *` every 30 minutes
- `0 * * * *` every hour
- `0 0 * * *` every day
